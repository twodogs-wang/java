### simple:

Java is relative simple compare to c++. It has no header files, no pointer, structures, unions, operator overloading, virtual bases classes, and so on.

### object oriented:

The main difference between Java and c++ lies in multiple inheritance, which Java has replace with a simpler concept of interfaces.

### distributed:

### robust:

Java puts a lot of emphasis on early checking for possible problems, later dynamic(runtime) checking.  Java also has a pointer model that eliminates the possibility of overwriting memory and corrupting data.

### secure:

### architecture-neutral

### portable:

This is important. As in c++, the size of certain data type is platform dependent. But in Java, sizes are specified.

### interpreted:

Until Java 9 that the "jshell" tool supported program like python(interpreted).

### high-performance:

### multi-threaded:

### dynamicï¼š
